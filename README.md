The final year of an Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) course is a critical and important phase for students. So, Takeoff Projects understood the importance and developed Mini Projects for EEE Students. In this crucial stage, students are often required to undertake mini projects that not only demonstrate their theoretical knowledge but also showcase their practical skills. These mini projects serve as a platform for students to apply what they have learned throughout their academic journey, fostering innovation and enhancing their problem-solving abilities.
